# SimpleJoin
This plugin aims to provide you the tools adjust join and leave 
messages as you wish. This plugin does offer more complex
customisable options. 

Allowing you to define
<ul>
    <li>Sound Effects</li>
    <li>Title Messages</li>
    <li>Normal Messages</li>
    <li>Action Bar Messages</li>
    <li>Boss Bar Messages</li>
    <li>Potion Effects</li>
    <li>Custom Commands</li>
</ul>

to be run when a player joins or leaves.

## Future Additions
I do plan to add clickable/hoverable messages that can have defined actions
ran/executed on click.
